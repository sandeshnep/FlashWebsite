				I am originally from Chicago, IL and moved to Philadelphia, PA during my freshman year of high school. There, I took my first computer science class that piqued my interest in the subject. This interest however developed late in high school, so I started school at the University of Rochester actually as an international relations major. I concurrently took a computer science course and significantly enjoyed it more, so I changed major to computer science and havenâ€™t looked back.
